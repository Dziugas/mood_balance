    I come from Lithuania and my real name is hard to pronounce for most foreigners. It stands for “Joyful” - a
    trick of fate, I sometimes think to myself. An introvert to the bone, I do not like too much attention. And since
    the topic of this blog is somewhat sensitive I decided to go under a nickname. So, please, just call me Jimmy. At
    least for now, hope you understand.<br><br>

    I am 33 years old and I have been dealing with depressive states, anxiety, mood swings, recurring thoughts
    and symptoms of OCD since I was a teenager. Needless to say, all these problems affected my results in
    studies, work and relationships with people I love - my family, friends, girlfriends and sometimes even
    random folks.<br><br>

    For years I tried to heal myself with alcohol, weed, sleep and similar escapism. It was kind of OK during the
    normal states of my existence, yet during the life’s ups and downs, these habits would swing my feelings to
    extreme highs and lows making me inactive, unfocused, easily irritated, depressed and helpless.<br><br>

    A few years ago, when I was going through a very low patch, my mother encouraged me to seek help. I started
    therapy and was lucky to meet a doctor who understood me. Now I am sober and more in control of my
    life. Being me still ain’t a candy, but now I can deal with life’s challenges with more ease and
    self-esteem. My doctor calls my package of problems Cyclothymia.<br><br>

    Mood Balance is my blog about reaching for the joy in life. I will write and share links about things that
    help me deal with Cyclothymia - therapy, staying sober, yoga, meditation, sports, food or taking a walk once
    in a while when nothing else helps.<br><br>

    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> this site is not for whining about how hard mine or anybody else's state of being is.
    Yes, life is hard sometimes.
    For everyone. Yet, here I want us to focus on the good things.
